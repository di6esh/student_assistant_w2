# 🎓 Student Assistant Web App

The Student Assistant Web App is a modern and responsive front-end application designed to help students stay organized and productive in their academic life. It provides an intuitive interface with dedicated pages for features, user authentication (sign-in & sign-up UI only), about information, and a contact form. The UI focuses on accessibility, clean design, and smooth interaction, making it a simple yet effective academic assistance platform concept.

This project is fully front-end based and showcases strong understanding of web development fundamentals including page structuring, component layout design, responsive styling, animations, navigation handling, and UI behavior using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project is deployed live on Vercel for easy access and demonstration.
